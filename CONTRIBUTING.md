### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement

```markdown
## Enhancement: Add workflow template categories

**Problem**: Currently hard to find specific template types among 2700+ templates

**Proposed Solution**: Add category filtering to search-templates tool
- Categories: Marketing, Development, HR, Sales, etc.
- Filter parameter: `category: "Marketing"`

**Benefits**:
- Faster template discovery
- Better user experience
- More organized template library

**Examples**:
```typescript
// Search only marketing templates
await searchTemplates({
  query: "email",
  category: "Marketing"
});
```
```

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

**Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(workflow-creator): add template category filtering

Adds ability to filter templates by category in search-templates tool.
This helps users find relevant templates faster.

Closes #42

---

fix(database): correct AI nodes count query

The query was returning an object instead of number.
Changed to extract .count property correctly.

---

docs(readme): update installation instructions

Added Docker Hub pull instructions and improved
troubleshooting section.
```

**Rules:**

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Style Guide

**General Principles:**

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Use TypeScript features for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns in the project

**Formatting:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good
export interface WorkflowInput {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  active?: boolean;
}

export async function createWorkflow(
  input: WorkflowInput
): Promise<WorkflowOutput> {
  try {
    const workflow = await n8nClient.createWorkflow(input);
    return {
      success: true,
      workflowId: workflow.id
    };
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to create workflow:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
export interface WorkflowInput{name:string;description:string;active?:boolean;}
export async function createWorkflow(input:WorkflowInput):Promise<WorkflowOutput>{try{const workflow=await n8nClient.createWorkflow(input);return {success:true,workflowId:workflow.id};}catch(error){logger.error('Failed',error);throw error;}}
```

**Naming Conventions:**

```typescript
// Interfaces: PascalCase
interface WorkflowConfig {}

// Functions: camelCase
function createWorkflow() {}

// Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;

// Private methods: prefix with _
class MyClass {
  private _internalMethod() {}
}
```

**Async/Await:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Use async/await
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await api.get('/data');
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid promise chains when async/await is clearer
function fetchData() {
  return api.get('/data')
    .then(result => result)
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
      throw error;
    });
}
```

**Error Handling:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Always handle errors explicitly
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error
    ? error.message
    : 'Unknown error';
  return { success: false, error: errorMessage };
}
```

### Documentation Style Guide

**Code Comments:**

```typescript
/**
 * Create a new n8n workflow from a natural language description
 *
 * @param input - Workflow description and configuration
 * @returns Created workflow details including ID and URL
 * @throws {Error} If n8n API is unreachable or returns an error
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const workflow = await createWorkflow({
 *   description: "Send email every Monday at 9am",
 *   name: "Weekly Email Reminder"
 * });
 * console.log(workflow.workflowUrl);
 * ```
 */
export async function createWorkflow(
  input: CreateWorkflowInput
): Promise<CreateWorkflowOutput> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**README Updates:**

- Keep language clear and concise
- Use headings hierarchically (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
- Include code examples for new features
- Update table of contents if adding new sections
- Use emoji sparingly and consistently

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

Labels help us track and manage issues and pull requests:

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `question`: Further information is requested
- `wontfix`: This will not be worked on
- `duplicate`: This issue or PR already exists
- `invalid`: This doesn't seem right

### Development Tips

**Testing Locally:**

```bash
# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Build and test
npm run build
npm test

# Test with Docker
docker build -t n8n-mcp-test .
docker run -it --rm n8n-mcp-test
```

**Debugging:**

```typescript
// Use debug logging
console.debug('Workflow data:', workflow);

// Enable verbose logging in .env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**Database Changes:**

If you modify the database schema:

1. Update `src/database/schema.sql`
2. Update the migration logic in `scripts/init-db.ts`
3. Test with a fresh database: `rm data/nodes.db && npm run db:init`
4. Document the changes in your PR
